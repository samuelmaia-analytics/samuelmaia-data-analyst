## Executive Summary

I build analytics systems that help business teams trust data, act faster, and make better commercial decisions.
This portfolio is intentionally curated to reflect a level of analytical maturity aligned with production-minded analytics engineering, revenue analytics, data quality, BI applications, and business-facing analytical delivery.

The emphasis is not on project count.
It is on decision value, architectural clarity, governed outputs, and credible execution from ingestion to executive consumption.

This repository should be read as a premium portfolio hub and a working platform scaffold.
It combines flagship portfolio projects with a root-level enterprise-style analytics platform that demonstrates contracts, observability, semantic metrics, GenAI-assisted insight drafts, governance controls, and dbt-like analytics engineering structure.

## Value Proposition

For recruiters, this portfolio shows a strong combination of analytics engineering discipline and business framing.

For data leaders, it demonstrates how I structure analytical products with clear runtime ownership, reproducible outputs, contracts, observability, and downstream consumption paths.

For potential clients, it shows how data work can be translated into revenue protection, retention prioritization, KPI standardization, and stakeholder-ready applications instead of isolated notebooks or disconnected dashboards.

## Technical Architecture

The portfolio is organized around analytical systems rather than isolated analyses.
Across the main repositories, the recurring operating model is:

```text
source data -> ingestion -> validation -> transformation -> semantic/KPI layer
-> modeling or scoring -> governed artifacts -> dashboard/API/SQL consumption
```

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Source Data] --> B[Ingestion]
    B --> C[Validation and Quality Gates]
    C --> D[Transformation Layers]
    D --> E[Semantic and KPI Layer]
    E --> F[Modeling or Scoring]
    F --> G[Governed Artifacts]
    G --> H[Dashboards]
    G --> I[APIs]
    G --> J[SQL and BI Consumption]
```

Core architectural patterns demonstrated across the portfolio:

- layered data flows such as `raw -> bronze -> silver -> gold`
- business logic separated from presentation surfaces
- dashboards that consume generated artifacts instead of becoming a second source of truth
- contract-aware outputs for reporting, processed exports, and downstream consumers
- local-first reproducibility with clear upgrade paths toward warehouse and enterprise connectors
- analytical products designed around business questions, not only technical implementation

## Governance and Data Quality

Governance is a visible part of the portfolio because analytical trust matters as much as modeling accuracy.

Examples of governance and quality signals present across the main repositories:

- data contracts and schema validation
- explicit repository structures and ownership boundaries
- architecture decision records
- runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and release notes
- quality reports and governed processed artifacts
- compatibility and deprecation discipline where legacy paths exist
- issue templates, PR templates, CODEOWNERS, and contribution standards

### Analytics Engineering Signals

- `raw`, `staging`, `intermediate`, and `marts` layers under [`dbt/`](./dbt)
- source definitions, schema tests, SQL data tests, and metric layer
- business logic and lineage-oriented documentation
- local dbt-like validation runner over the SQLite warehouse
- semantic consistency between KPI definitions, marts, contracts, and downstream surfaces

## CI/CD

The strongest repositories go beyond basic unit tests.
They use CI/CD as evidence that the work is reproducible, reviewable, and operationally coherent.

Signals already demonstrated in the portfolio include:

- linting, formatting, type checking, and automated tests
- smoke testing for Streamlit apps and API surfaces
- build validation for packages and containers
- downstream SQL and dbt validation
- repository-governance and operational-asset checks
- release notes and publication workflows

    D --> E[Build and Release Discipline]

```

## Proof of Execution

This portfolio is designed to show implemented capability, not only intended direction.

Execution evidence visible across the main repositories includes:

- live public demos
- generated artifacts and governed exports
- smoke-tested dashboards and APIs
- release notes tied to repository evolution
- repository structures that map documentation claims to code and tests

### Current Platform Capabilities

- executive dashboards and protected API endpoints
- change-driver monitoring with configurable materiality thresholds
- runtime configuration review and governance policy checks
- historical metric, domain, and project trend tracking
- GenAI-assisted drafts for KPI narrative, glossary, anomaly explanation, and executive summary
- dbt-like analytics engineering layer with documented model flow

## Operational Signals

Senior-level analytical work should be inspectable not only from the modeling layer, but from the operating layer.

Operational signals demonstrated across the portfolio include:

- canonical runtime paths
- documented environments and setup flows
- runbooks, troubleshooting guides, and incident-style documentation
- explicit quality gates and validation commands
- release and change discipline
- local-first reproducibility with enterprise-oriented upgrade paths

## How I Create Business Value

My work is designed to answer practical business questions such as:

- Where is revenue at risk and what should the business act on first?
- Which customers, channels, categories, or segments deserve prioritization?
- How should KPI logic remain stable across pipelines, dashboards, and executive reviews?
- How do governance, quality controls, and CI/CD improve confidence in analytical outputs?

Typical value delivered through these systems:

- revenue protection through prioritization logic
- retention visibility through customer risk segmentation
- faster decision cycles through artifact-backed dashboards and KPI layers
- improved analytical credibility through governed outputs and reproducible workflows
- cleaner stakeholder handoff through documentation, contracts, and operational assets

    F --> G[Revenue Protection or Efficiency Gain]
```

## Why This Portfolio Is Different

Most public data portfolios optimize for model variety or dashboard count.
This one is designed to show how analytical work behaves when treated like a real product surface.

What makes it different:

- stronger emphasis on business framing than on isolated technical tricks
- architectural consistency across projects
- governance and operating signals that are usually missing in portfolios
- analytical outputs tied to stakeholder decisions
- a clear bridge between analytics engineering, BI, data quality, and product thinking
- a visible platform scaffold that makes the operating model inspectable at repository level
